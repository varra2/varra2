- 👋 Hi, My name is Varvara. I'm a graduate biophysics from Russia. I might say I'm a newbe in programming, but not a total newbe. I have some small experience working with python scrypts, which use numpy and matplotlib libraries. I also have some experience with wisualising molecules in PyMol and working with Gromacs for molecular dynamics simulations.
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, including bioinformatic, data analysys and, unexpectedly, game gevelopment.
- 🌱 I currently keep on learning python and also the basics of C. I plan to start on leraning data alnalysis, machine learning and bioinformatics in near time. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any python projects that need extra hands. I want to acquare experience with programming so I'm looking for small tasks I could handle (even the boring ones) Although, it would be most interesting for me to participate in creating a game, I've never had any experience in this sphere but it seems to me as a very exciting thing to do.
